# Finding Information BSc 1
This is the repository for the default lecture slides for information literacy as taught for first year bachelor students in economics and business at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

The lecture slides are made using `Rmarkdown` and the `xaringan` package, which in turn is based in `remarkjs`.
